# Pre-commit Setup Summary

## ✅ What Was Installed

### Dependencies
- **husky** (v9.1.7): Modern Git hooks manager
- **lint-staged** (v16.2.4): Run linters on staged files only

### Git Hooks Created

1. **`.husky/pre-commit`** (Active)
   - Runs ESLint on staged files and auto-fixes issues
   - Runs Jest tests related to changed files
   - Runs full test suite

2. **`.husky/pre-commit.fast`** (Alternative)
   - Only runs lint-staged (no full test suite)
   - Much faster for large projects

3. **`.husky/pre-push`** (Active)
   - Runs full test suite before pushing to remote
   - Prevents pushing broken code

## Configuration

### package.json
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky"
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,ts,astro}": [
      "eslint --fix"
    ],
    "*.{js,ts}": [
      "jest --bail --findRelatedTests --passWithNoTests"
    ]
  }
}
```

## How It Works

### On `git commit`:
1. Husky intercepts the commit
2. Runs ESLint on staged `.js`, `.ts`, `.astro` files
3. Auto-fixes linting issues
4. Runs Jest tests for related files
5. Runs full test suite
6. If all pass ✅, commit succeeds
7. If any fail ❌, commit is blocked

### On `git push`:
1. Husky intercepts the push
2. Runs full test suite (`npm test`)
3. If tests pass ✅, push succeeds
4. If tests fail ❌, push is blocked

## Recommendations

### For Better Performance
The current setup runs the full test suite on every commit, which can be slow. Consider:

**Option 1**: Switch to fast pre-commit + pre-push tests
```bash
cd .husky
mv pre-commit pre-commit.full
mv pre-commit.fast pre-commit
```

**Option 2**: Remove full test suite from pre-commit
Edit `.husky/pre-commit` and remove the `npm test` line.

### For Maximum Safety
Keep the current configuration (already set up).

## Testing the Hooks

Try making a commit to test:
```bash
# Make a small change
echo "// test" >> assets/js/tests/example-tests.js

# Stage and commit
git add assets/js/tests/example-tests.js
git commit -m "test: verify pre-commit hook"
```

You should see:
- Linting running
- Tests running
- Commit succeeds if all pass

## Bypassing Hooks (Emergency Only)
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency commit"
git push --no-verify
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Only use in true emergencies!

## Troubleshooting

### Hooks not running?
```bash
npm run prepare
```

### Want to disable a hook temporarily?
```bash
chmod -x .husky/pre-commit
```

### Re-enable:
```bash
chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the hooks by making a commit
2. If commits are too slow, switch to the fast configuration
3. Update team documentation about the new hooks
4. Add commit message linting if needed (commitlint)
