# Building Accessible Web Applications: A Practical Guide

Web accessibility isn't just a nice-to-have—it's a fundamental requirement for creating inclusive digital experiences. This guide covers practical techniques for building accessible web applications.

## Understanding Web Accessibility

Web accessibility (a11y) ensures that websites and applications can be used by everyone, including people with:

- Visual impairments
- Hearing impairments
- Motor disabilities
- Cognitive disabilities

## WCAG Guidelines

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a framework organized around four principles:

### 1. Perceivable

Information must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

**Example**: Provide text alternatives for images

```html
<img 
  src="chart.png" 
  alt="Sales growth chart showing 25% increase in Q3"
/>
```

### 2. Operable

User interface components must be operable by all users.

**Example**: Ensure keyboard accessibility

```javascript
// Good: Keyboard-accessible button
<button 
  onClick={handleClick}
  onKeyPress={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && handleClick()}
>
  Submit
</button>
```

### 3. Understandable

Information and interface operation must be understandable.

**Example**: Provide clear error messages

```html
<input 
  type="email" 
  aria-describedby="email-error"
  required
/>
<span id="email-error" role="alert">
  Please enter a valid email address
</span>
```

### 4. Robust

Content must be robust enough to work with various technologies.

## Practical Accessibility Techniques

### Semantic HTML

Use appropriate HTML elements for their intended purpose:

```html
<!-- Good -->
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>

<!-- Avoid -->
<div class="nav">
  <span onclick="navigate()">Home</span>
</div>
```

### ARIA Attributes

Use ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility when semantic HTML isn't sufficient:

```html
<button 
  aria-label="Close dialog"
  aria-pressed="false"
>
  <span aria-hidden="true">×</span>
</button>
```

### Focus Management

Ensure visible focus indicators and logical focus order:

```css
/* Visible focus indicator */
button:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid #007bff;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

### Color Contrast

Maintain sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA: 4.5:1 for normal text):

```css
/* Good contrast */
.text {
  color: #212529;  /* Dark gray */
  background: #ffffff;  /* White */
  /* Contrast ratio: 16.1:1 */
}
```

## Testing Accessibility

### Automated Testing

Use tools like:
- **axe DevTools**: Browser extension for automated testing
- **Lighthouse**: Built into Chrome DevTools
- **WAVE**: Web accessibility evaluation tool

### Manual Testing

1. **Keyboard Navigation**: Navigate using only keyboard (Tab, Enter, Escape)
2. **Screen Reader Testing**: Test with NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver
3. **Zoom Testing**: Test at 200% zoom level
4. **Color Contrast**: Use contrast checking tools

## Common Accessibility Pitfalls

1. **Missing alt text** on images
2. **Poor focus management** in modals and dialogs
3. **Insufficient color contrast**
4. **Missing form labels**
5. **Keyboard traps** in interactive components
6. **Unclear error messages**

## Best Practices Checklist

- [ ] All images have descriptive alt text
- [ ] Forms have associated labels
- [ ] Interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- [ ] ARIA attributes are used correctly
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] Content structure is logical and semantic
- [ ] Page has a proper heading hierarchy
- [ ] Skip navigation links are provided

## Conclusion

Building accessible web applications requires intentionality and ongoing effort, but the result is a better experience for all users. Start with semantic HTML, test regularly, and iterate based on user feedback.

Remember: Accessibility is not a feature—it's a fundamental aspect of quality web development.
