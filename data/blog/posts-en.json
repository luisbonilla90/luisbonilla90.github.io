In this article, I share the key lessons learned while building a media intelligence platform capable of processing over 5,000 URLs per hour...\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n### Microservices vs Monolith\n\nWe started with a modular monolith and gradually extracted services as bottlenecks emerged...\n\n### Database Design\n\nPostgreSQL proved to be an excellent choice for our needs, providing both relational integrity and JSON support...\n\n## Scaling Strategies\n\n### Horizontal Scaling\n\nImplementing a queue-based architecture with Redis enabled us to scale processing workers independently...\n\n### Caching Layer\n\nStrategic caching reduced database load by 70%...\n\n## Monitoring and Observability\n\nPrometheus and Grafana provided crucial insights into system performance...\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBuilding scalable systems is an iterative process that requires continuous monitoring and refinement."
