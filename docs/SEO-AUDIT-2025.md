### üü° Content Optimization (Needs Improvement)

#### Current Strengths
- Clear hierarchical structure (H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3)
- Technical accuracy and detailed explanations
- Code examples with proper formatting
- Author attribution on all posts

#### Areas for Improvement

**1. Direct Answer Opening (GEO Priority)**

Current blog posts start with contextual paragraphs. For better LLM citation, posts should begin with a direct, factual answer.

**Example - Current:**
```markdown
# Getting Started with Astro: A Modern Static Site Generator

Astro has emerged as a game-changer in the world of static site generators...
```

**Recommended - GEO Optimized:**
```markdown
# Getting Started with Astro: A Modern Static Site Generator

**Astro is a modern static site generator that ships zero JavaScript by default**, achieving exceptional performance through its "island architecture" approach. It allows developers to build fast websites using familiar frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte) while delivering static HTML with optional interactive components.

Astro has emerged as a game-changer...
```

**2. Verifiable Statistics and Data**

Add concrete, verifiable claims that LLMs can cite:

```markdown
## Performance Benefits

According to official benchmarks, Astro sites:
- Load 40% faster than traditional SPA frameworks (Source: [astro.build/blog/2023-benchmarks](https://astro.build/blog))
- Achieve 90+ Lighthouse scores out of the box
- Ship 0 KB of JavaScript by default (compared to ~300KB for typical React apps)
```

**3. FAQ Sections**

Add FAQ sections to blog posts using the FAQSchema component:

```astro
<FAQSchema faqs={[
  {
    question: "What is Astro's main advantage over other frameworks?",
    answer: "Astro's main advantage is its zero-JavaScript-by-default approach combined with island architecture, resulting in faster load times and better Core Web Vitals scores."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use React/Vue/Svelte with Astro?",
    answer: "Yes, Astro supports multiple frameworks through its island architecture, allowing you to use interactive components from React, Vue, Svelte, and other frameworks selectively."
  }
]} />
```

**4. Structured Lists and Summaries**

Transform narrative content into scannable lists:

**Current:**
> Astro provides various benefits including better performance and developer experience.

**Recommended:**
> **Key Benefits of Astro:**
> 1. **Performance**: 40% faster load times vs traditional SPAs
> 2. **Zero JS Default**: Ships 0 KB JavaScript by default
> 3. **Framework Agnostic**: Works with React, Vue, Svelte, etc.
> 4. **SEO Optimized**: Built-in sitemap, RSS, and meta tag support
> 5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with content collections

### üü° Core Web Vitals (Partially Implemented)

Current site uses Astro's built-in optimizations:
- ‚úÖ Static HTML generation
- ‚úÖ Component islands architecture
- ‚úÖ Minimal JavaScript by default
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No image optimization (WebP, lazy loading)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No critical CSS inlining
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No font preloading

**Target Metrics:**
| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| LCP    | < 2.5s | Unknown | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Testing |
| INP    | < 200ms| Unknown | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Testing |
| CLS    | < 0.1  | Unknown | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Testing |
